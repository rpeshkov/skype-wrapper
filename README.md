## Description

Sets of icons for patched Sni-Qt. To use this icons you need to install my update for Sni-Qt package first. You can install it from ppa:rpeshkov/ppa. Patched Sni-Qt is available for Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 14.04. All derivative distributions supported too (such as Elementary OS Luna).

## Note for Mint (Cinnamon) users

Since Cinnamon uses native tray, my patch for Sni-Qt doesn't affect anything.

## Usage

    git clone git://github.com/rpeshkov/skype-wrapper.git ~/bin/skype-wrapper
    cd ~/bin/skype-wrapper
    sudo ./install.sh unity # for Unity users
    sudo ./install.sh elementary # for Elementary OS users
